# This is an example of:
#     A crawler (see below)
#        That uses a "skater" f (from the timemachines package) to estimate future mean and std
#           And restricts its attention to certain streams relating to the FAANG stocks
#              And further restricts its attention to the longer prediction horizons (15 mins and 1hr)
#
# A "crawler" is a descendent of the MicroCrawler class that:
#        watches https://www.microprediction.org/stream_dashboard.html?stream=gnaaf_00113 and other streams
#           maintains a manifest of when and what to predict
#                 grabs lagged data values using api.microprediction.org
#                      submits 225 guesses of future values
#
# A sentient data scientist can also improve the accuracy of the predictions, naturally, and make even more money.
